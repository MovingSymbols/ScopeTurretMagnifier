# 3D-Printed Scope Turret Magnifier(s)
These are the project files for a simple scope turret magnifier.  It is 3D printed and uses 1 inch PCX lenses (magnification lenses)
It is made to attach to a 1 inch scope tube, and secures with two M3 bolts and nuts.
The lens retainer piece needs to be glued.

## What Does It Do?
My up-close vision is a bit bad when I shoot because I am wearing my "everyday far away" glasses.  That means that seeing the fine graduations on the adjustment turrets is tough.

This solves that by putting mild magnification lenses in front of the turrets.  Think of it as reading glasses for the itty bitty numbers and lines.

There is one for the elevation, and one for the windage. Two lenses in total.

## This Looks a Bit Familiar
Yeah, the idea is inspired by MK Machining's product for the same purpose (which is also 3D printed) https://www.mkmachining.com/product/gen-ii-pro-series-turret-magnifier/

## YMMV
This is very much just my own design that fits my optic and the lenses I had on hand. Probably you'll need to fiddle with them if you want it for your own use. 
If it helps, the lenses are from a Google cardboard headset knockoff (to give you an idea of what kind of lenses they are.)
